- [½] existential types
# Python
- [ ] Return tuples
# Array
- [ ] accept path to BLAS as argument
- [ ] SIMD in IR rather than too functional
  - [x] start with 128-bit pairs for copy?
# `C.Trans`
- [ ] "return tuple as two registers"
- [ ] return array as stack-allocated
  - [ ] "return data view" when some necessary parameters (e.g. dimension, rank)
    are known—e.g. for sliding window, don't need to copy an intermediate
  - [ ] return array as stack-allocated
